Title: Word Repetition in Text Documents

Assignment questions:

1. Using decomposition, what are the primary sub-problems that need to be solved in solving the overall problem?

- Finding matches of a word.
- Finding matches of synonyms to the word in question.

2. Using pattern recognition, what patterns do you see in the solution, i.e., what processes need to be repeated?

- Match characters of the word within all matching characters in the text.

3. Using data abstraction and representation, how would you represent the thesaurus, the corpus, and each of the documents in the corpus?

4. Using the results of the first three pillars, what is the algorithm that you would use to solve this problem? Describe it in as much detail as possible.

5. Describe a problem that you may face -- either in your career or in everyday life -- that involves determining the number of occurrences of a word and its synonyms in a corpus of documents. The problem you face may be much bigger than that and require that calculation as only a small part of the solution, but should involve looking through some collection of text and looking for certain words.
