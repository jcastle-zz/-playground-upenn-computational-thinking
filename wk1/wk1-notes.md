# Week 1 Notes

## Decomposition

- Computation thinking is an approach to solving problems using ideas and concepts from computer science.
- Allows for taking a complex problem, understand what the problem involves, and develop possible solutions.
- There are four what we call pillars to computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, data representation, and abstraction.
- Decomposition is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems.
- By solving each potentially simpler sub-problem, we can put the solutions together to arrive at a solution to the original complex problem.

## Pattern Recognition
