# Week 1 Notes

## Decomposition

- Computation thinking is an approach to solving problems using ideas and concepts from computer science.
- Allows for taking a complex problem, understanding what the problem involves, and developing possible solutions.
- There are four pillars to computational thinking:
  1. Decomposition
  2. Pattern recognition
  3. Data representation and abstraction
  4. Algorithms
- Decomposition is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems.
- By solving each potentially simpler sub-problem, we can put the solutions together to arrive at a solution to the original complex problem.
- Important large computational problems (e.g., mapping the earth). Sub-problems can be large and need to be decomposed.

## Pattern Recognition

- Finding similarities or shared characteristics within or between problems.
- Makes the problem easier to solve since the same solution can be used for each occurrence of the pattern.

## Data Representation and Abstraction

- Determining what characteristics of the problem are important and filtering out those that are not.
- Use these to create a representation of what we are trying to solve.

## Algorithms

- Step-by-step instructions of how to solve a problem.
- Identifies what is to be done (the instructions), and the order in which they should be done.
- Can be described in English, as a flowchart, or by using pseudocode.
